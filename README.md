Janrain Capture
===============

Configurable support and markup for janrain capture widget/modals


Settings
--------

With the exposed init(settings) function, a few things are expected:

settings.settings - a dataobject containing app id, client id, among other things
settings.capture - more settings janrain expects like federation, social info, etc
settings.useMarkup - if you wish to use the bundled markup, set to 'true' (default)
